At this moment I am using the Code:Blocks for creating the projects. <br/>
When you need to compile the project in Code:Block, it will be necessary to transfer the code for the main.cpp, because the Code:Blocks runs in cmd this archive. <br/>

If anyone knows how to change this, please let me know.

Thank you
